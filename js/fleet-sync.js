/* Fleet Sync. Opt-in cross-device sync of this app's army list.
 *
 * WHY EVERYTHING HERE IS NAMESPACED `dzc`
 *
 * This started as the Dropfleet builder's file and kept its keys. Both builders
 * are GitHub Pages sites under type37.github.io, which means ONE origin and
 * therefore ONE localStorage between them, and both talked to the same
 * Firestore document `sync/{token}`. So turning sync on in either app turned it
 * on in the other, on the same token, and the two games' lists merged into a
 * single array: Dropfleet fleets appeared in the Dropzone app and Dropzone
 * armies appeared in the Dropfleet app. The merge is game-agnostic by design --
 * it moves opaque {id, updatedAt} records and never looks inside them -- so it
 * could not possibly have noticed.
 *
 * Two changes stop it, and both are needed:
 *
 *   - Local keys are `dzc_sync_*`, so "sync is on" is a fact about THIS app.
 *   - The document ID is `dzc-<token>`, so the same six words name a different
 *     document in each game. One token, two lists, never mixed.
 *
 * Design, and why it looks like this:
 *
 * - There is no account and no password. A Sync Token is a six-word phrase that
 *   doubles as the Firestore document ID. Knowing the phrase is the entire
 *   credential. This is deliberate (the user asked for no sign-in), and the app
 *   copy says so plainly, because anyone holding the token can read AND edit.
 *
 * - Talks to Firestore over its plain REST API rather than the Firebase SDK.
 *   The SDK is ~400 KB and would have to come from a CDN, which fights this
 *   app's offline-first service worker. `fetch` costs nothing and keeps the app
 *   dependency-free with no build step.
 *
 * - The whole fleet list travels as ONE JSON string in a single `payload` field.
 *   Firestore's REST format otherwise requires tagging every value with its type
 *   ({stringValue}, {integerValue}, nested {mapValue}...), which for deeply
 *   nested fleet objects would be a lot of pointless conversion code.
 *
 * - The API key below is not a secret. Firebase web keys ship in client JS by
 *   design; they identify the project, they do not authorise anything. Access is
 *   controlled entirely by firestore.rules in the repo root.
 *
 * Merge rules: union by fleet id, newest `updatedAt` wins on a collision, and
 * deletions travel as tombstones so a fleet deleted on one device does not come
 * back from the cloud on the next pull. Nothing is ever silently dropped.
