/* Fleet Sync — opt-in cross-device sync of the shared `dfc_fleets` list.
 *
 * Loaded by BOTH apps (index.html and mobile/index.html), same as offline-sync.js,
 * so the merge rules can never drift between desktop and phone.
 *
 * Design, and why it looks like this:
 *
 * - There is no account and no password. A Sync Token is a six-word phrase that
 *   doubles as the Firestore document ID. Knowing the phrase is the entire
 *   credential. This is deliberate (the user asked for no sign-in), and the app
 *   copy says so plainly, because anyone holding the token can read AND edit.
 *
 * - Talks to Firestore over its plain REST API rather than the Firebase SDK.
 *   The SDK is ~400 KB and would have to come from a CDN, which fights this
 *   app's offline-first service worker. `fetch` costs nothing and keeps the app
 *   dependency-free with no build step.
 *
 * - The whole fleet list travels as ONE JSON string in a single `payload` field.
 *   Firestore's REST format otherwise requires tagging every value with its type
 *   ({stringValue}, {integerValue}, nested {mapValue}...), which for deeply
 *   nested fleet objects would be a lot of pointless conversion code.
 *
 * - The API key below is not a secret. Firebase web keys ship in client JS by
 *   design; they identify the project, they do not authorise anything. Access is
 *   controlled entirely by firestore.rules in the repo root.
 *
 * Merge rules: union by fleet id, newest `updatedAt` wins on a collision, and
 * deletions travel as tombstones so a fleet deleted on one device does not come
 * back from the cloud on the next pull. Nothing is ever silently dropped.
